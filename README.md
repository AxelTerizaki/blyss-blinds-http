# RFXCOM Blinds

A simple tool I made to manipulate Blyss blinds via a RFXCOM USB emitter/receiver

This is more a proof of concept as it needs a lot of work to make it right. I personally use it with homebridge and its plugin homebridge-blinds-http

As this is a NodeJS project, a `npm install` will install everything you need. Note that RFXCOM needs a working build environment for its native extension.

Remember to replace the blinds codes in the index.js file to match your own.
